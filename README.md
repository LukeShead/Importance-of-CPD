# Importance-of-CPD

### What is CPD.

CPD stands for Continuous Professional Development, it is where a professional will continue to learn the more modern discoveries within their field of work. For example if a doctor finished their degree in 1970, their knowledge would slowly go out of date as more modern medicine is developed, because of this the doctor must keep up to date on all of the most modern discoveries within the field they are in so that they can keep giving their patients the best treatment that they can get. This is what CPD is and it is why the term is vey important for professionals in modern society as without CPD, many people that work hard in order to earn their degrees and qualifications will not be able to do their job anymore as their knowledge will be outdated.

### The importance of CPD.

CPD is one of the most important terms for a professional, being able to keep up to date on what the newest developments with the field of work means that someone can keep being good at their job, because of the world always developing, professionals must also develop around it. If someone doesn't keep up to date then it will be difficult for that person to keep up with their job, as companies are constantly looking to improve it means that the employees will also have to look at improving with it to stay at that company. Without it companies would lose a lot of their profit having to constantly hire new people, this would mean spending more money on training new staff rather than improving the company needs. This is why CPD is so important to companies and individuals, as it keeps people and companies from becoming outdated.
